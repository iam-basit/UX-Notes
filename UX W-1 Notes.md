# What is user Experience Design:

- User experience is all about how a person or user feels and interacting or experiencing a product. And a product can be a good a service or a feature.

- For a product that user can have good experience must be:
    - Usable
        - if a product is usable , it means the design, structure, and purpose of the product is clear and easy to use.

        - As you evaluate a product for usability, you can ask questions like: 
            - Is everything in the design easy to find? 
            - Is the design’s functionality easy to understand? 
            - Can users accomplish specific tasks within the design? 
            - As you evaluate, these questions can help you determine whether the design delivers a usable experience.




    - Equitable
        - Being equitable means your product must be useful and marketable to the people divers abilities and background.

        - In other words, the product’s design addresses the needs of a diverse audience and ensures a high-quality experience is delivered to all users regardless of background, gender, race, or ability. Equity means providing people with the tools they need to accomplish their goals and support improved quality of life. Equity goes beyond the concept of equality, where everyone is given equal resources, because people often need different tools and support based on their needs.
        
        - As you evaluate the equity of a product’s UX, you can ask questions like:
            - Are the needs of a diverse group of users considered? 
            - Does the product’s design address the needs of traditionally underrepresented and excluded groups? 
            - These questions can help you determine whether the design delivers an equitable experience.

    - Enjoyable
        - If a product is enjoyable , it means the design delights the user. The design reflects what the user may be thinking or feeling and creates a positive connection with them. A product’s design doesn’t have to be enjoyable for it to function properly. But, an enjoyable design adds to an already functional product and can enhance the user’s feelings about the experience.
        -  As you evaluate how enjoyable a product’s UX is, you can ask questions like: 
            - Are there aspects of the design that consider the user’s feelings?
            - Does the design inspire delight in the user?
            - Does the design keep the user engaged throughout their experience? 
            - These questions can help you determine whether the design delivers an enjoyable experience.

    - Useful
         - product must solve a problem.
         - As you evaluate how useful a product’s UX is, you can ask questions like:
         -  Does the design add value to the user’s experience?
         -  Does the design solve a problem for the user?
         -  Does the design help the user achieve a specific goal? 
          - These questions can help you determine whether the design delivers a useful experience.
