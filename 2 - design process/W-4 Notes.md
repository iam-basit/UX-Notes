> Problem statement

 A clear description of user's needs that should be addressed.

- how to wite problem statement
 we use the following statement:
 (user name ) is a (user characteristic) who needs (user needs) because (insight).

- problem statement principles
    - Human-centered
    - broad enough for creative freedom
    - narrow enough to be solved by a design
- problems statement benefits
    - establish goals
    - understand constraints
    - define deliverables
    - create benchmarks for success

> The 5 Ws and H: who, what, when, where, why, and how

The most common framework used to create problem statements is the 5 Ws and H framework. After you define the user’s pain points, you can answer who, what, when, where, why, and how to solve the user’s problem.


- Who is experiencing the problem? Knowing your users and their background is key to creating successful solutions for them.

- What are the pain points you’re trying to solve? Determining a user’s pain points early allows you to answer the rest of these questions and clarify the context of the pain points.

- Where is the user when they’re using the product? A user’s physical context matters to your design.

- When does the problem occur? Maybe it’s right after the end of a long and tedious process, or maybe it’s something that happens daily. Knowing when the problem occurs can help you better empathize with the user’s feelings.

- Why is the problem important? Knowing how this problem affects your user’s experience and life will help to clarify the potential consequences.

- How are users reaching their goals by using the product? Understanding how users reach their goals allows you to map the user journey that they take through your product.

> Hypothesis statement

Out best educated guess on what we think the solution to a design problem might be.

- how to write hypothesis statement
 we use the (If,Then) statement which  "If" is  action and "Then" is outcome.

 > Value proposition

 The reason why customer should use a product or service

To make a valuable product you should answer the following questions:
 - What does your product do?
 - Why should the user care? 


# Psychological concepts and effects

 > Human factors

  Describes the range of variables humans bring to their product interaction.

Common humans factors that inform design
- impatience
- limited memory
- needing analogies
- limited concentration
- changes in need
- needing motivation
- prejudices
- fear 
- making mistakes
- misjudgment

> Mental models

Internal maps that allow humans predict how something will work.

> Feedback loops

The outcome a user gets at the end of a process. 

> Von Restorff effect (Isolation effect)

When multiple similar objects are present the one which differs with the rest is most likely the remembered.

- In UX design this is why the call to action (CTA) button must be different with the rest.

- CTA 
    - A visual prompt that tells the user to take action .

> Serial position effect 
 
 When people are given a list of items, they are more likely remember the first few and the last few, while the items in the middle are tend to blur.

 > Hick's Low
  
The more options user has the longer it takes to take decision.
