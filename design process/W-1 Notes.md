Answers the following questions:

- how should we build it /

3. Post launch research:

> UX research method:

 How you get research done.
 - Here is two ways we categorize research methods:
    - who conducts the research?
    - Based on the type of data collected.
##### First we are focusing who is conducting the research?
#### Primary research:

   -  research you do by yourself.

#### Secondary research:
    
- research that users information that someone has put together.
      - stats,facts, and figures that already exist

- Benefits:

    - Save time and money
    - Immediately accessible
    - Backs primary research
 - Drawbacks:
   - Not first-hand user interaction
   - No specific user feedback

 ##### Here we are focusing on what kind of data research is done:

- Quantitative research: (what)
      - focusing on data that can be gathered by counting and measuring.

- Qualitative research: (why)
      - focuses on observation why and how things happen. 

##### Common research methods
#### interviews:
   - a research method use to collect in-dept information on people's opinions, thoughts, experience, and feelings.

   - Benefits:
      - Understands what user thinks and why.
      - Ask followup questions
   - Drawbacks:
      - Take time and money
      - Small sample size

#### Surveys:
   - an activity that people asked the same question in order to understand what most people thinks about product.

   - Benefits:
       - Large sample size 
       - Fast
       - Inexpensive 
   - Drawbacks:
      - No in-depth feedbacks
#### Usability study:
   - is a technique to evaluate a product by testing it on user to understand the pain pints that user experience during using product   

   - Benefits:
      - Firsthand user interaction
      - Challenge our assumptions 
      - In-depth feedback
   - Drawbacks:
      - Only measures how easy a product is to use
      - Expensive
      - Difference in lab use and verses real life 


> Bias in UX design:
- Bias is the way humans interpret and evaluate the context and information about something according to how these are presented or how they perceive these through the lens of their values and beliefs.

- Kinds of biases:
   - conformation bias
   - false consensus bias
   - primary bias
   - recency bias
   - implicit bias
   - Sunk cost fallacy

1. Conformation biases:

   Occurs when you start looking for evidence to proof a hypothesis you have.

   - overcoming conformation bias

      - ask open-ended questions
      - actively listen
      - include large number of users

2. False consensus bias:
   
   overestimate the number of people who will agree with out idea or design

   - overcoming false consensus bias:

      - identify and articulate your own assumptions
      - survey large groups of people


3. Recency bias:
   it is easiest to remember the last thing you heard.
    
- overcoming recency bias:
   - take detailed notes or recording 
   - interview each participant in the same way
4. primacy bias:

      remember the first participant most strongly 

- overcoming primacy bias:
   - take detailed notes or recording 
   - interview each participant in the same way


5. Implicit bias:

    the collection of attitudes and stereotypes we associate with people without our conscious knowledge.

- overcoming implicit bias:
   - reflect on our own behaviors
   - aks other the point out implicit biases 

6. Sunk cost fallacy:

   the deeper we get into the project we have invested in, the harder it is to change the course.

 - overcoming sunk cast fallacy:

   - break down your project into smaller phases
   - outline the points where you can decide whether to continue or stop
