> Design Sprint:

A time bound process with five phases typically spread over five full 8 days where designers tackle designing problems.

1. understand
2. ideate
3. decide
4. prototype
5. test

-  - Phase 1: Understand

In the Understand phase, you will create a shared knowledge base across all participants. Using the Lightning Talk method, knowledge experts across the business are invited to articulate the problem space from business, user, competitor, and technological angles.


- - Phase 2: Define

In the Define phase, the team evaluates everything they learned in the Understand phase to establish focus. This is done by defining specific context and desired outcomes of potential solutions. The phase concludes by choosing a specific focus for your Sprint, as well as goals, success metrics, and signals.

- - Phase 3: Decide

In the Decide phase, the Design Sprint team finalizes the direction or concept to be prototyped. Each participant will share their Solution Sketch, and the team will find consensus on a single idea through decision-making exercises. The final direction will aim to address the Design Sprint focus.

- - Phase 4: Prototype

In the prototype phase, the Design Sprint team generates and shares a broad range of ideas as individuals. You will start by looking for inspiration, such as solutions in alternative spaces. Then, each Design Sprint participant will individually generate ideas for consideration. From there, the team will narrow down ideas as group to a single, well-articulated Solution Sketch per person.


- - Phase 5: Test

In the test phase, the Design Sprint team will put your concept in front of users - this is your moment of truth! You will gather feedback from users who interact with your prototype, and if relevant, you will conduct stakeholder and technical feasibility reviews. You’ll end your Sprint with a validated concept– or an invalidated concept to improve on. Either way, you’ve made progress.

 - Design sprint goal:

  solve a critical design challenge through designing, prototyping, and testing ideas with users.

  - Design sprint benefits:
    - save time
    - create path to bring a product into market 
    - prioritize the user 
    - test product before launch 
    - lower risks
    - versatile schedule 

- When to sprint:

if any of the following question gets a "Yes" then it is better to go with sprint.
   
1. Many potential solutions to challenges?
1. Cross-functional teams needed to weigh in?
1. Challenge scope wide enough?


- Plan design sprint:

  - user research
  - call in the experts
  - find the right space 
  - gather supplies
  - establish sprint rule 
  - plan interdiction
  - post-sprint planning   


- Sprint brief:
  
   A document that you share with all your attendees the help them prepare for sprint.
    
    - topics that should be included in your sprint brief:

    1. sprint challenges

        example:

        building new features for the cycling app in time for relaunch later in this year.

    1. key deliverables 
        example:

        a complete prototype that includes the feature updates.

    1. logistics
        example:

        - where?
        - when?
        - who?
        - sprint leader: someone who sends the sprint brief to team.
    1. approvers
    1. resources
    1. project overview:
         - current state fo project
         - roadblocks
         - early wins,if any
         - estimated launch plan
    
    1. sprint schedule:
        example: five days planing

 - Retrospective:
   A collaborative critique of the team design sprint.

   - Key question in retrospective:
    -  what went well?
    - what can be improved?
