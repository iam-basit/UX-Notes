> UX design frameworks:
1. Universal design
2. Inclusive design
3. Equity-focused design.



### Universal design:
(one size fits all)
The process of creating one product for users with the widest range of abilities and int the widest range of situations.

### Inclusive design:
(solve for one extend to many)

 Making design choices that take into account personal identifiers like:

- Ability
- Race
- Economic state
- Age 
- Language
- Gender

Accessibility:

The design of products, devices, services, or environment for the people with disabilities. 

### Equity-focused design:

Thinking about all aspects of designed product and making suer that product is accessible to all genders, race, and abilities.

 plus, designing for the groupe of people that have been historically underrepresented or ignored when building product.

- - Equality :
    
    is providing the same amount of opportunity and support.
-  - Equity:

        is  providing different level of opportunity and support for each person in order to achieve fair outcome.

> Assistive Technology (AT):

 Any product, equipment, and system that enhance learning, working and daily live for people with disabilities.

 - Color modification
 - Voice control
 - Screen readers
 - Alternative texts 

 - - Switch:
    an assistive technology device that replace the need to use computer keyboard or mouse.

> Design Thinking process:

The Design Thinking framework is a user-centered approach to problem-solving that includes activities like research, prototyping, and testing to help you understand who your user is, what their problems are, and what your design should include.

Design Thinking framework has the following phases:
- Empathize
- Define
- Ideate
- Prototype
- Test
 

 Empathize:

 During empathize phase, the primary goal is to learn about user needs, problems, wants, and the environment or context they will experience your design.It is important to mention to step away from your assumptions and guesses and do the research to find information and make 

 Define:

In the phase of define you are going to analyze your findings from empathize phase and determine which user problem is the most important ones to solve,and why.And it will give you a clear goal to design your product.

Ideate:
 The goal of ideation is to generate designs as many solutions as possible and do not settle for your first solution because the most obvious one not always the right one.And it is recommended to have collaborative brainstorming with other members of the group.

 Prototype:

 Here your goal is to produce an early model product that can determine the functionality and can be used for testing. 

 Testing:

 The testing phase is critical to develope the right solution to address your user problem, and an organized approach to testing can help you create an exceptional user experience.

 Prototyping and testing are  interconnected, which means that youâ€™ll  test your designs at each stage of prototype development rather than waiting to test until after the working prototype is complete.
