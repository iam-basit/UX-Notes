      - focusing on data that can be gathered by counting and measuring.

   - Qualitative research: (why)
      - focuses on observation why and how things happen. 

#### Key performance indicators (KPIs):
   - Critical measures of progress towards an end goal:

#### Bias in UX design:
- Bias is the way humans interpret and evaluate the context and information about something according to how these are presented or how they perceive these through the lens of their values and beliefs.

- Kinds of biases:
   - conformation bias
   - false consensus bias
   - primary bias
   - recency bias
   - implicit bias
   - Sunk cost fallacy

1. Conformation biases:

   Occurs when you start looking for evidence to proof a hypothesis you have.

   - overcoming conformation bias

      - ask open-ended questions
      - actively listen
      - include large number of users

2. False consensus bias:
   
   overestimate the number of people who will agree with out idea or design

   - overcoming false consensus bias:

      - identify and articulate your own assumptions
      - survey large groups of people


3. Recency bias:
   it is easiest to remember the last thing you heard.
    
- overcoming recency bias:
   - take detailed notes or recording 
   - interview each participant in the same way
4. primacy bias:

      remember the first participant most strongly 

- overcoming primacy bias:
   - take detailed notes or recording 
   - interview each participant in the same way


5. Implicit bias:

    the collection of attitudes and stereotypes we associate with people without our conscious knowledge.

- overcoming implicit bias:
   - reflect on our own behaviors
   - aks other the point out implicit biases 

6. Sunk cost fallacy:

   the deeper we get into the project we have invested in, the harder it is to change the course.

 - overcoming sunk cast fallacy:

   - break down your project into smaller phases
   - outline the points where you can decide whether to continue or stop
